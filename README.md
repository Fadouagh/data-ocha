# data-ocha
Data science study group at Leading program, Ochanomizu University.

Our study group explores machine learning with python. 

# Study plan

*April 2019*

1) basic programming in python (objects, types, iteration, functions)

*May 2019*

2) data structures that we will use to store ML data (lists, numpy, DataFrame)
3) useful libraries to work with ML data (matplotlib, scikit-learn)

*June & July 2019*

4) machine learning models with python (regression, decision tree, random forests, nearest neighbors...)

*August 2019*

5) our first ML project
